# QRona

a not very serious Corona Certificate Validator

See https://qrona.plix.at for a running instance

And see https://domm.plix.at/talks/qrona.html for slides and a video explaining the code.

Written using Perl, Object::Pad, Plack and vue.js.

The original Corona Certificate Validator was written by [Maroš Kollár](https://github.com/maros)
